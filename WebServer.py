'''
addictional work achieved
Addition1 : Binding the Web Server to a configurable port, defined as an optional argument
Addition2 : When a requested file is not available on the server, return a response with the status code Not Found (404)
Addition3 : Create a multithreaded server implementation, capable of handling multiple concurrent connections
Addition4 : implement a Client Server
